=============

Precise translation of arcade games from the 1980's

Branch Recover_APR2015:
I managed to wipeout the "eightysArcade" repo on github ... yay! 
I found locally stored clones that allowed the history up to October 2015 to
be restored. Also from local files I am able to restore changes I had made
between October 2015 and now (now being April 2015 when I last touched the
project) ... this will be one big changeset which I will then attempt to
merge back to master and try to recreate some of the changeset documentation
in the commit comments. yay!
