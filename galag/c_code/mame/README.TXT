    Note to the GPL from Nicola and Mirko :

    This General Public License does not limit the use of MAME specific
    source code (drivers, machine emulation etc.). Use of the code is even
    encouraged. But do note that if you make a 'derived' work as stated in
    the full GPL, it is required that full source code must be made available.

    Making available full source code will benefit both the MAME project
    developers and MAME users and is the sole reason for bringing MAME
    under the GPL.


Important note:  from now on I, Mirko, am the coordinator of project MAME.
I created a new account address for those of you who intend to contribute to
MAME with drivers, or bug fixes.  The address is  "mame@lim.dsi.unimi.it".
If you have personal mails (requests or other) send them to my standard
e-mail address.  Thank you for collaboration.

Please note that many people helped with this project, either directly or
by making source code available which I examined to write the drivers. I am
not trying to appropriate merit which isn't mine. See the acknowledgemnts
section for a list of contributors.

  (4 bits per pen), while I currently use only 8 bits (3 bits for red and
  green, 2 bits for blue).
- There is a bit in the sprite attributes which I don't know what means:
  it seems to be set only when the (B) materializes.
- The INITIAL HIGH SCORE setting doesn't only set that, it does something
  else as well - but I don't know what.

=====================

The original machine had a special joystick which could be moved either
partially or fully in a direction. Pushing it slightly would turn around the
player without moking it move. The emulator assumes that you are always
pushing the joystick fully, to simulate the "half press" you can press Alt.

Known issues:

Usage
-----

MAME [name of the game to run] [options]

for example

MAME mspacman -nosound   will run Ms Pac Man without sound

options:
-noscanlines  use alternate video mode (not availble in all games). Use this
              if the default mode doesn't work with your monitor/video card.
-vesa         use standard 640x480x256 VESA mode instead of custom video mode.
              Use this as a last resort if -noscanlines doesn't solve your
              video problems.
-vesascan     use a VESA 800x600 screen to simulate scanlines. This is much
              slower than the other video modes. Use this if you want
              scanlines and the default video mode doesn't work.
-vesaskip n   similar to -vesascan, but use a 640x480 screen instead of
              800x600. Since most games use a screen taller than 240 lines,
              it won't fit in the screen - n sets the initial number of lines
              to skip at the top of the screen. You can adjust the position
              while the game is running using the PGUP and PGDOWN keys.
-vgafreq n    where n can be 0 (default) 1, 2 or 3.
              use different frequencies for the custom video modes. This
              could reduce flicker, especially in the 224x288noscanlines
              mode. WARNING: THE FREQUENCIES USED MIGHT BE WAY OUTSIDE OF
              YOUR MONITOR RANGE, AND COULD EVEN DAMAGE IT. USE THESE OPTIONS
              AT YOUR OWN RISK.
-vsync        syncronize video display with the video beam instead of using
              the timer. This works best with -noscanlines and the -vesaxxx
              modes. Use F11 to check your actual frame rate - it should be
              around 60. If it is lower, try to increase it with -vgafreq (if
              you are using a tqeked video mode) or use your video board
              utilities to set the VESA refresh rate to 60 Hz.
              Note that when this option is turned on, speed will NOT
              downgrade nicely if your system is not fast enough.
-soundcard n  select sound card (if this is not specified, you will be asked
              interactively)
-nojoy        don't poll joystick
-log          create a log of illegal memory accesses in ERROR.LOG
-list         display a list of currently supported games
-frameskip n  skip frames to speed up the emulation. For example, if the game
              normally runs at 60 fps, "-skipframe 1" will make it run at 30
              fps, and "-skipframe 2" at 20 fps. Use F11 to check the fps your
              computer is actually displaying. If the game is too slow,
              increase the frameskip value. Note that this setting can also
              affect audio quality (some games sound better, others sound
              worse).


The following keys work in all emulators:

3       Insert coin
1       Start 1 player game
2       Start 2 players game
Tab     Change dip switch settings
P       Pause
F3      Reset
F4      Show the game graphics. Use cursor keys to change set/color, F4 to exit
F8      To select keys assignment.
F9      To change volume percentage thru 100,75,50,25,0 values
F10     Toggle speed throttling
F11     Toggle fps counter
F12     Save a screen snapshot
ESC     Exit emulator
